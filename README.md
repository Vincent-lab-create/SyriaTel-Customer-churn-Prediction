# SyriaTel-Customer-churn-Prediction
# Project Overview
This project aims to help SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, reduce revenue loss by predicting which customers are likely to stop using their services soon. By analyzing customer data, we explore whether there are predictable patterns in customer behavior that signal impending churn.
# Business Understanding
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunication industry and SyriaTel is no exception. High churn rates directly translate to lost revenue, reduced profitability and high customer acquisition costs. My primary goal is to come up with a classifier that will predict whether a customer will stop using SyriaTel's services.
# Key Business Questions
- How does customer service interaction quality impact churn?
- Are customers on flexible or prepaid plans more prone to churn compared to those on fixed contracts?
- How do external market factors (e.g., competitor promotions, pricing wars) correlate with churn?
- Do demographic factors like age, gender, or occupation correlate with churn risk?
